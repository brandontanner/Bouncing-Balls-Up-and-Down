### Description

After selecting the number of balls to create, that many balls will be created in random colors. These balls will then bounce up and down across the browser at different heights as well as bounce off the walls. 

### Installation

1. Download the zip file in github and load **projectile.html** it in a browser.
2. Enter the console and type ```factory()```, inputting the number of balls within the parenthesis and pressing the "enter" key. For example, if you wanted to display 10 balls, you could type ```factory(10)```.
3.  Next, type ```update()``` and press "enter", and the balls should begin to bounce.
